NoSQL Challenge

Contributor: Gabriela Delgado

Overview

This project was meant to look at UK food data to help journalists decide what to write their articles on based on hygiene ratings.

This Challenge contains a ReadMe file, the data sets, and the HTML files.

Git Bash

I used GitBash to download the repository to my desktop and push and commit the changes made to the code into the repository

NoSQL: Mongodb, Pymongo

These programs were used to be able to look at the data, create querys, look at the collections and documents of the places. I also took a look at a list of restaurants based on a range of latitudes and longitudes.

Acknowledgments:

Tutor Sandhya Kumari for helping me load the database into Mongodb and for helping me debug some of my line codes.
